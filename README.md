# GrowAnim 0.1 Houdini python script
Script for animation of 3D models.

An old script that I wrote back in 2019. I was faced with the task of animating a lot of buildings. If I did all the work by hand, I would have to spend a lot of time. And I made a script that sped up the whole process dozens of times.
